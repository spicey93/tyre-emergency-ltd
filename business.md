About
We are an emergency roadside assistance service that specialises in fast response tyre replacement. We cover Mansfield, Newark, Worksop, Retford, and surrounding areas.
Our aim is to get to you as quickly as possible, and provide clear communication throughout the process. It's stressful being stranded on a busy road so we have built the business around efficiency and speed. Tyres are stored nearby to the fitters, we share our location with you so you know where we are at all times throughout the process, pricing is quick and transparent with no hidden fees. And our technicians are highly experienced so once we arrive we can get the job done quickly and effectively. We also have the tools on board to deal with locking wheel nut and tyre pressure sensors issues on the spot.
Founded by Dean Spicer - born in Dorset and I've been the tyre trade from the age of 20. Worked for large national chains and smaller family businesses throughout the years. Mobile and depot experience. Light mechanical experience with servicing, brakes, suspension ect. Not a car guy so not really into fixing cars but I've always enjoyed helping people at the side of the road so that's why I've positioned the business as such.
I am only limited to cars, vans, caravans, motorhomes, trailers and suvs. I don't deal with motorbike, scooter, hgv, or agricultural tyres.
We also don't offer puncture repairs, we just replace tyres.
